# Download your Slack emojis

    cargo install --git https://github.com/M3t0r/slack-emoji.git

NB: This isn't using official Slack APIs. It might stop working at anytime. The token has to begin with `xoxs-` and isn't one that Slack gives you. You have to extract it from the network traffic in your browser. And it doesn't seem to expire. _Be careful!_
